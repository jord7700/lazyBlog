    <h1>Hi! This is my site</h1>
    <p>You can expect to find the things I want to make here. I will probably talk about things like video games, TTRPGs, art, music, programming, and my general musings</p>
    <p>Things are a little sparse right now. I want to style things a bit at some point. Links to other pages are above,
        links to socials are below</p>
